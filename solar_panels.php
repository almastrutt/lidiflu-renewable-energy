                    <br><br><b>Monocrystalline</b> are the oldest and most developed of the three technologies. Monocrystalline panels are created from a single continuous crystal structure. These Monocrystalline panels can be identified from the solar cells which all appear as a single flat color.

                    start as a silicon crystal ‘seed’ placed in a vat of molten silicon. Unlike Monocrystalline that draw silicon crystal seed up the vat of silicon is simply allowed to cool. This is what forms the distinctive edges and grains in the solar cell. Polycrystalline are very close to Monocrystalline cells in terms of efficiency.

                    <br><br><b>Thin Film</b> solar panels are second generation solar cells, made by depositing one or more thin layers, or thin film (TF) of photovoltaic material on a substrate, such as glass, plastic or metal. Commercially used in several technologies, these solar panels are an affordable option while a lifetime of 20 years or more is expected.
