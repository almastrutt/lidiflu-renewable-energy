                    <br><br><b>Solar Panels</b> catch the sun's energy and convert it into electricity that can be used to power household. Solar thermal allows you to heat water and can cut down heating bills.

                    There are many simple yet effective ways to insulate your home, which can significantly reduce heat loss while lowering your heating bills. Insulating an attic is a simple and effective way to reduce heating bills, while insulating beneath floorboards could save approximately Â£40 per year.

                    <br><br><b>Wind Turbines</b> harness the power of the wind and use it to generate electricity.
                    About 40 per cent of all wind energy in Europe blows over the UK, making it an ideal country for domestic turbines. A typical system in an exposed site can easily generate more power than your lights and electrical appliances use.
